│  Community on the Cardano Blockchain shall be recognized, recorded and assessed fairly through reward sharing with SPOs, potential compensation to DReps and CC members, and     │
│  appropriate tokenomics.”\\n\\nFurthermore, according to Article VII, Section 8, “Cardano Blockchain ecosystem budgets shall provide for periodic administrative costs of the    │

│  Summary\\n\\nWhile Cardano offers an on-chain mechanism to compensate Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) for their work and Delegate Representatives (DReps) may be compensated by     │
│  Ada holders (Article V, Section 5), the Constitutional Committee (CC) is “limited to voting on the constitutionality of governance actions” (Article VII, Section 1)            │
│  regardless of personal preference or community sentiment. Carrying out this mandate requires careful review of governance actions, familiarity with the Constitution and        │
│  governance mechanisms, and the capacity to act impartially. CC members also face significant administrative costs in performing these duties, including research,               │
│  deliberation, drafting, and participation in cross-time-zone meetings.\\n\\nWithout compensation from a neutral source, participation risks being limited to those able to      │
│  subsidize these costs themselves or they may be subsidized by another institution. This could result in an “ivory tower” where only the wealthy or well-connected are able to   │
│  serve. Establishing a reasonable budget for compensation from the Cardano Treasury ensures that service in the CC accessible to a broad range of qualified contributors and     │
│  the institution itself remains distinct and independent.\\n\\n### Participating Members\\n\\nThis governance action was built from discussion between the seven currently       │
│  serving members of the CC and will provide for the compensation of five of these members.\\n\\nThe members seeking compensation are:\\n\\nCardano Atlantic Council,             │

│  Summary\\\\n\\\\nWhile Cardano offers an on-chain mechanism to compensate Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) for their work and Delegate Representatives (DReps) may be compensated    │
│  by Ada holders (Article V, Section 5), the Constitutional Committee (CC) is “limited to voting on the constitutionality of governance actions” (Article VII, Section 1)         │
│  regardless of personal preference or community sentiment. Carrying out this mandate requires careful review of governance actions, familiarity with the Constitution and        │
│  governance mechanisms, and the capacity to act impartially. CC members also face significant administrative costs in performing these duties, including research,               │
│  deliberation, drafting, and participation in cross-time-zone meetings.\\\\n\\\\nWithout compensation from a neutral source, participation risks being limited to those able to  │
│  subsidize these costs themselves or they may be subsidized by another institution. This could result in an “ivory tower” where only the wealthy or well-connected are able to   │
│  serve. Establishing a reasonable budget for compensation from the Cardano Treasury ensures that service in the CC accessible to a broad range of qualified contributors and     │
│  the institution itself remains distinct and independent.\\\\n\\\\n### Participating Members\\\\n\\\\nThis governance action was built from discussion between the seven         │
│  currently serving members of the CC and will provide for the compensation of five of these members.\\\\n\\\\nThe members seeking compensation are:\\\\n\\\\nCardano Atlantic    │

│  Budget\\\\n\\\\nThe total amount of this budget shall be 1,000,000 Ada.\\\\n\\\\nEach of the five members seeking compensation shall be allowed to request up to 200,000 Ada    │
│  as part of a single Treasury Withdrawal pursuant to the budget.\\\\n\\\\n### Administrator\\\\n\\\\nThe Administrator of this budget shall be a customized version of the open  │
│  source Cardano Treasury/Vendor Smart Contract developed by Intersect & Sundae Labs. This Smart Contract will be deployed with the following conditions:\\\\n\\\\n#### Funding   │
│  Method\\\\n\\\\n* A separate smart contract instance will be deployed for each CC member to ensure individualized oversight and accounting.\\\\n* These five smart contract     │
│  instances will be concurrently funded subject to the passage of a Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action specifying the amount that each contract is due to receive.\\\\n* The   │
│  Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action must be approved for submission by all members seeking compensation.\\\\n\\\\n#### Withdrawal Logic\\\\n\\\\n* The designated CC member   │
│  may withdraw funds from the smart contract to an account in their custody once every six epochs.\\\\n* Each withdrawal equals the proportionate share of their service time in  │
│  the 73-epoch funding term (i.e., pro-rata vesting based on actual service).\\\\n* Assets in the smart contract will only be able to be sent to the CC member account specified  │
│  upon launch or the Cardano Treasury.\\\\n\\\\n#### Oversight & Audit Mechanism\\\\n\\\\n* Each CC member’s smart contract will be overseen and auditable by the other four CC   │
│  members.\\\\n* The other four CC members collectively hold the authority to pause further withdrawals if the designated member is no longer serving in their CC role.\\\\n*     │
│  There will be no capability in the smart contract to change the recipient of funds. If the CC member wishes to receive compensation to another account for some reason (i.e.    │
│  they lost access to their original account) they will need to make a new budget request to Ada holders.\\\\n\\\\n#### Expiration & Fund Recovery\\\\n\\\\n* Any funds           │
│  remaining in the contract six epochs after the close of the 73-epoch funding term will be swept back into the Cardano Treasury, ensuring no stranded or unclaimed funds         │
│  persist indefinitely.\\\\n\\\\n### Dispute Resolution\\\\n\\\\nDispute resolution under this framework is handled directly by the smart contract through a vote of the four     │
│  Constitutional Committee members overseeing each smart contract instance. If concerns arise regarding a designated member’s eligibility or continued service, the remaining CC  │
│  members may cast votes within the contract to determine whether withdrawals should be paused or allowed to continue. A defined majority threshold ensures that no single        │
│  member can unilaterally block or reinstate payments, while still allowing the CC itself to resolve disputes internally without requiring an external institution.\\\\n\\\\n###  │
│  Reporting\\\\n\\\\\nCC members will be expected to provide a public address, controlled by the individual or entity receiving funds, at the time they submit a Treasury         │
│  Withdrawal Governance Action. This ensures transparency and accountability, as Ada holders will be able to independently review and verify each withdrawal by tracing           │
│  transactions from the smart contract to the designated CC member’s custodied account using any blockchain explorer.\\\\n\\\\nIf it becomes necessary to freeze a contract and   │
│  suspend withdrawals, that action and its justification must be publicly reported by the CC members voting to take such action. This will ensure that the community is aware of  │
│  any exceptional circumstances.\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nIn conclusion, this framework provides a balanced approach to compensating Constitutional Committee members in   │
│  a manner that is transparent, accountable, and aligned with Cardano’s governance principles. By leveraging smart contracts to automate withdrawals, enforce vesting schedules,  │
│  and allow peer oversight with the ability to pause payments, the system ensures both fairness to participants and protection of community resources. The requirement for        │
│  public reporting of custodied addresses and withdrawal records further reinforces trust, while the automatic return of unclaimed funds to the Treasury safeguards against       │
│  waste.\\\\n\\\\nMost importantly, this model allows the CC to operate as an independent institution, free from undue influence or reliance on outside funding sources, thereby  │
│  strengthening its ability to exercise impartial judgment in overseeing constitutional governance.\\\\n\\\\n##                                                                   │

│  owners.”\",\"rationale\":\"### Executive Summary\\\\n\\\\nWhile Cardano offers an on-chain mechanism to compensate Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) for their work and Delegate      │
│  Representatives (DReps) may be compensated by Ada holders (Article V, Section 5), the Constitutional Committee (CC) is “limited to voting on the constitutionality of           │
│  governance actions” (Article VII, Section 1) regardless of personal preference or community sentiment. Carrying out this mandate requires careful review of governance          │
│  actions, familiarity with the Constitution and governance mechanisms, and the capacity to act impartially. CC members also face significant administrative costs in performing  │
│  these duties, including research, deliberation, drafting, and participation in cross-time-zone meetings.\\\\n\\\\nWithout compensation from a neutral source, participation     │
│  risks being limited to those able to subsidize these costs themselves or they may be subsidized by another institution. This could result in an “ivory tower” where only the    │
│  wealthy or well-connected are able to serve. Establishing a reasonable budget for compensation from the Cardano Treasury ensures that service in the CC accessible to a broad   │
│  range of qualified contributors and the institution itself remains distinct and independent.\\\\n\\\\n### Participating Members\\\\n\\\\nThis governance action was built from  │
│  discussion between the seven currently serving members of the CC and will provide for the compensation of five of these members.\\\\n\\\\nThe members seeking compensation      │

│  Budget\\\\n\\\\nThe total amount of this budget shall be 1,000,000 Ada.\\\\n\\\\nEach of the five members seeking compensation shall be allowed to request up to 200,000 Ada    │
│  as part of a single Treasury Withdrawal pursuant to the budget.\\\\n\\\\n### Administrator\\\\n\\\\nThe Administrator of this budget shall be a customized version of the open  │
│  source Cardano Treasury/Vendor Smart Contract developed by Intersect & Sundae Labs. This Smart Contract will be deployed with the following conditions:\\\\n\\\\n#### Funding   │
│  Method\\\\n\\\\n* A separate smart contract instance will be deployed for each CC member to ensure individualized oversight and accounting.\\\\n* These five smart contract     │
│  instances will be concurrently funded subject to the passage of a Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action specifying the amount that each contract is due to receive.\\\\n* The   │
│  Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action must be approved for submission by all members seeking compensation.\\\\n\\\\n#### Withdrawal Logic\\\\n\\\\n* The designated CC member   │
│  may withdraw funds from the smart contract to an account in their custody once every six epochs.\\\\n* Each withdrawal equals the proportionate share of their service time in  │
│  the 73-epoch funding term (i.e., pro-rata vesting based on actual service).\\\\n* Assets in the smart contract will only be able to be sent to the CC member account specified  │
│  upon launch or the Cardano Treasury.\\\\n\\\\n#### Oversight & Audit Mechanism\\\\n\\\\n* Each CC member’s smart contract will be overseen and auditable by the other four CC   │
│  members.\\\\n* The other four CC members collectively hold the authority to pause further withdrawals if the designated member is no longer serving in their CC role.\\\\n*     │
│  There will be no capability in the smart contract to change the recipient of funds. If the CC member wishes to receive compensation to another account for some reason (i.e.    │
│  they lost access to their original account) they will need to make a new budget request to Ada holders.\\\\n\\\\n#### Expiration & Fund Recovery\\\\n\\\\n* Any funds           │
│  remaining in the contract six epochs after the close of the 73-epoch funding term will be swept back into the Cardano Treasury, ensuring no stranded or unclaimed funds         │
│  persist indefinitely.\\\\n\\\\n### Dispute Resolution\\\\n\\\\nDispute resolution under this framework is handled directly by the smart contract through a vote of the four     │
│  Constitutional Committee members overseeing each smart contract instance. If concerns arise regarding a designated member’s eligibility or continued service, the remaining CC  │
│  members may cast votes within the contract to determine whether withdrawals should be paused or allowed to continue. A defined majority threshold ensures that no single        │
│  member can unilaterally block or reinstate payments, while still allowing the CC itself to resolve disputes internally without requiring an external institution.\\\\n\\\\n###  │
│  Reporting\\\\n\\\\nCC members will be expected to provide a public address, controlled by the individual or entity receiving funds, at the time they submit a Treasury          │
│  Withdrawal Governance Action. This ensures transparency and accountability, as Ada holders will be able to independently review and verify each withdrawal by tracing           │
│  transactions from the smart contract to the designated CC member’s custodied account using any blockchain explorer.\\\\n\\\\nIf it becomes necessary to freeze a contract and   │
│  suspend withdrawals, that action and its justification must be publicly reported by the CC members voting to take such action. This will ensure that the community is aware of  │
│  any exceptional circumstances.\\\\n\\\\n## Conclusion\\\\n\\\\nIn conclusion, this framework provides a balanced approach to compensating Constitutional Committee members in   │
│  a manner that is transparent, accountable, and aligned with Cardano’s governance principles. By leveraging smart contracts to automate withdrawals, enforce vesting schedules,  │
│  and allow peer oversight with the ability to pause payments, the system ensures both fairness to participants and protection of community resources. The requirement for        │
│  public reporting of custodied addresses and withdrawal records further reinforces trust, while the automatic return of unclaimed funds to the Treasury safeguards against       │
│  waste.\\\\n\\\\nMost importantly, this model allows the CC to operate as an independent institution, free from undue influence or reliance on outside funding sources, thereby  │
│  strengthening its ability to exercise impartial judgment in overseeing constitutional governance.\\\\n\\\\n##                                                                   │
