│  Governance Action must be approved for submission by all members seeking compensation.\\n\\n#### Withdrawal Logic\\n\\n* The designated CC member may withdraw funds from the   │
│  smart contract to an account in their custody once every six epochs.\\n* Each withdrawal equals the proportionate share of their service time in the 73-epoch funding term      │
│  (i.e., pro-rata vesting based on actual service).\\n* Assets in the smart contract will only be able to be sent to the CC member account specified upon launch or the Cardano   │
│  Treasury.\\n\\n#### Oversight & Audit Mechanism\\n\\n* Each CC member\u2019s smart contract will be overseen and auditable by the other four CC members.\\n* The other four CC  │
│  members collectively hold the authority to pause further withdrawals if the designated member is no longer serving in their CC role.\\n* There will be no capability in the     │
│  smart contract to change the recipient of funds. If the CC member wishes to receive compensation to another account for some reason (i.e. they lost access to their original    │
│  account) they will need to make a new budget request to Ada holders.\\n\\n#### Expiration & Fund Recovery\\n\\n* Any funds remaining in the contract six epochs after the       │
│  close of the 73-epoch funding term will be swept back into the Cardano Treasury, ensuring no stranded or unclaimed funds persist indefinitely.\\n\\n### Dispute                 │
│  Resolution\\n\\nDispute resolution under this framework is handled directly by the smart contract through a vote of the four Constitutional Committee members overseeing each   │
│  smart contract instance. If concerns arise regarding a designated member\u2019s eligibility or continued service, the remaining CC members may cast votes within the contract   │
│  to determine whether withdrawals should be paused or allowed to continue. A defined majority threshold ensures that no single member can unilaterally block or reinstate        │
│  payments, while still allowing the CC itself to resolve disputes internally without requiring an external institution.\\n\\n### Reporting\\n\\nCC members will be expected to   │
│  provide a public address, controlled by the individual or entity receiving funds, at the time they submit a Treasury Withdrawal Governance Action. This ensures transparency    │
│  and accountability, as Ada holders will be able to independently review and verify each withdrawal by tracing transactions from the smart contract to the designated CC         │
│  member\u2019s custodied account using any blockchain explorer.\\n\\nIf it becomes necessary to freeze a contract and suspend withdrawals, that action and its justification     │
│  must be publicly reported by the CC members voting to take such action. This will ensure that the community is aware of any exceptional circumstances.\\n\\n##                  │
│  Conclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, this framework provides a balanced approach to compensating Constitutional Committee members in a manner that is transparent, accountable, and   │
│  aligned with Cardano\u2019s governance principles. By leveraging smart contracts to automate withdrawals, enforce vesting schedules, and allow peer oversight with the ability  │
│  to pause payments, the system ensures both fairness to participants and protection of community resources. The requirement for public reporting of custodied addresses and      │
│  withdrawal records further reinforces trust, while the automatic return of unclaimed funds to the Treasury safeguards against waste.\\n\\nMost importantly, this model allows   │

│  Representatives (DReps) may be compensated by Ada holders (Article V, Section 5), the Constitutional Committee (CC) is \u201climited to voting on the constitutionality of      │
│  governance actions\u201d (Article VII, Section 1) regardless of personal preference or community sentiment. Carrying out this mandate requires careful review of governance     │
│  actions, familiarity with the Constitution and governance mechanisms, and the capacity to act impartially. CC members also face significant administrative costs in performing  │
│  these duties, including research, deliberation, drafting, and participation in cross-time-zone meetings.\\n\\nWithout compensation from a neutral source, participation risks   │
│  being limited to those able to subsidize these costs themselves or they may be subsidized by another institution. This could result in an \u201civory tower\u201d where only    │
│  the wealthy or well-connected are able to serve. Establishing a reasonable budget for compensation from the Cardano Treasury ensures that service in the CC accessible to a     │
│  broad range of qualified contributors and the institution itself remains distinct and independent.\\n\\n### Participating Members\\n\\nThis governance action was built from    │
