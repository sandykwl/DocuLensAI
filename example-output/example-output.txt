{
  "originality": {
    "authorship_likelihood": "Multi-authored governance action with explicit signatories; deliberate domain-specific content; signatures included; evidence of governance process; not obviously AI-generated.",
    "evidence": [
      "Five council names listed as authors",
      "Public keys and signatures present in authors block",
      "References to Cardano Constitution and CIP108 in body",
      "IPFS hashes and on-chain metadata present",
      "Structured governance format with sections (Executive Summary, Budget, Administrator, etc.) typical of formal governance proposals"
    ],
    "template_detection": "High; structure aligns with CIP108 governance action templates; however content includes novel budget numbers and member list, suggesting a collaborative CC product rather than generic AI-generated text."

    "governance_structure_risks": [
      "Approval mechanism requiring consent of all five compensation-seeking CC members increases risk of deadlock or strategic manipulation if any member with influence withholds approval.",
      "Per-member smart contract accounts create multiple points of failure; misconfiguration could lead to uneven vesting or misallocation if one contract misbehaves.",
      "Six-epoch withdrawal cadence and 73-epoch term create long-term commitment; changes in CC membership or priorities over time could undermine ongoing compensation.",
      "Dispute resolution relies on internal votes within contract; potential for manipulation if internal voting rights or access are compromised."

    "financial_risks": [
      "Total budget of 1,000,000 ADA exposes treasury to price volatility; value fluctuation could affect opportunity costs.",

      "Independent contract governance may obscure full treasury accounting; requires robust audit trails."
    ],
    "operational_risks": [
      "Too much reliance on a customized treasury contract codebase from Intersect & Sundae Labs; potential bugs or vulnerabilities in code.",
      "Process requires on-chain actions by all five members; if one account is compromised or loses access, funding could be blocked.",

      "Smart contract logic must correctly implement pro-rata vesting; any miscalculation could result in over/under payment.",
